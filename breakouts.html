<h1>Breakout groups</h1>

<p>Every week after the presentation, we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps. The groups are split into two types: <a href='#working'>working</a> groups and <a href='#learning'>learning</a> groups.</p>

<p>Want to start your own breakout group? Just mention it at the next hack night and people will vote with their feet!</p>

<h2>Now on GitHub issues!</h2>

<p>This week, we're trying out a new way of listing our breakout groups by listing them as Issues on GitHub. </p>

<a class='btn btn-info' href='https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout/issues'><i class='fa fa-group'></i> See the breakout groups</a>


<a class='btn btn-danger' href='https://github.com/chihacknight/join-a-breakout#adding-your-breakout-group'><i class='fa fa-plus-circle'></i> Add your breakout group</a>

        <p>The “sharing economy” is much touted for its disruptive capabilities. Yet, many policy, legal, and regulatory issues intersect in nuanced ways in the “sharing economy.”  What are the long-term implications for customers/consumers and for low-wage workers who exist in the contradictory space between traditional, highly regulated systems and new, “disruptive” economic systems? How can technology be used to enhance the functionality of these systems and to strengthen consumer and driver’s rights?</p>

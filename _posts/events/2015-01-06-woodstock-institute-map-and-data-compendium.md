Julianna Nunez and Katie Buitrago from[Woodstock Institute](http://www.woodstockinst.org/) will demo two recently launched tools to help understand economic trends throughout the state of Illinois:

* [interactive map](http://www.woodstockinst.org/content/woodstock-institute-interactive-map) - a MapBox/TileMill-powered site that shows geographic patterns of employment, foreclosures, and more)
* [data compendium](http://compendium.woodstockinst.org/) - a CKAN site with dozens of datasets assembled by the former Metro Chicago Information Center and Woodstock Institute. 

Some of their data include: 
* Poverty levels
* Average loan values for mortgages
* Changes in long-term vacancies
* Employment rates
* The amount of foreclosure filings

Smart Chicago Collaborative and Chi Hack Night have teamed up to create a speaking series in celebration of Womenâ€™s History Month in an effort to elevate the talented, diverse women in civic-driven technology across Chicago.

**Panel discussion**

Wednesday, March 29th we will convene at the Homan Square Community Center and hear from panel of civic tech creators and founders to hear about their personal narratives. The panel will feature:

* Allyson Scrutchens of Forward Planning
* Dima Elissa of VisMed-3D
* Denise Linn of Smart Chicago (moderator)


**Civic hacking**

Once the panel wraps up, the format of the event switches up a mini-hackathon. People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects, discuss potential ideas, and share their skills.

Members of the Chi Hack Night community will be on site to run several of our popular breakout groups including:

* An introduction to civic tech
* Digital security 101

Food will be provided.

[Bo Rodda](https://twitter.com/b0rodda) will talk about his work with the [interactive 3D city model](http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2014/07/140701-Chicago-City-of-Big-Data.asp) at the [City of Big Data Exhibition](http://bigdata.architecture.org/).

Interested in projecting your own data on to the model? Now's your chance! Bo is working on a platform to allow anyone to submit their own visualization for public display.

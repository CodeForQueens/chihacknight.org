The [Chi Hack Night](www.chihacknight.org) (formerly known as the Open Gov Hack Night) is a free, weekly event in Chicago to build, share and learn about tools to create, support, and serve the public good. 

We are a group made up of designers, academic researchers, data journalists, activists, policy wonks, web developers and curious citizens who want to make our city more just, equitable, transparent and delightful to live in through data, design and technology. 

We were one of the very hack nights, with [Derek Eder](www.twitter.com/derekeder) and Juan Pablo Valez founding hack night about six months before the Code for America Brigade program started. We’re connected to the Brigade network where [Christopher Whitaker](www.twitter.com/civicwhitaker) serves as Brigade Captain for Chicago. Through this network, we share our work bringing together developers, community activists, data scientists, city employees, UX Designers, non-profit employees, and other people together to help make our communities better. 

Chi Hack Night is a learning community. Government and technology are both fields that are chock full of jargon and confusing terminology. At Chi Hack Night, attendees are encouraged to call out jargon and it’s one of the ways you can get a Chi Hack Night sticker. We run an orientation every week for new attendees to get familiar with open data, open source, and the importance of community organizing as part of our work. In addition, we have [several learning groups for people to gain knowledge - both in tech and civics](http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html).  

We’ll be sending a large delegation to the Code for America Summit this year and can’t wait to meet you all. Here’s our delegation roster!

Adam originally joined to meet the people in the civic tech space and learn from them.  Adam quickly discovered that the people, especially the folks that come to ChiHackNight, is what makes civic tech fun and rewarding.  And it is the people that Adam meets that make me want to work even harder and learn increasingly more so that he can contribute more.

Adam will be hosting a panel entitled [Communicating With Citizens Using Data Visualization](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_123) on Wednesday at 3:15.   

Here is the description: In this era of exploding data collection, analysis, and mining, data visualization as a way of communicating has never been more important-- especially between governments and the communities they serve. Hear from those who have used visualization to engage citizens around government transparency, transportation issues, urban planning, and environmental resiliency.

Adam is very interested in meeting everyone, as he thinks we can learn a great deal from our colleagues in this movement that are in other cities.

Adam is proud of the true community of thoughtful, intelligent, and interesting people in the civic tech space in Chicago and also about how the city government participates, and how the public sector employees encourage others to join in and create.

Adam is a vegetarian, and firmly believes that nothing beats a Veggie Chicago-Style hot dog

Alex Soble is a 2015 Code for America Fellow working with the City of Somerville and will be presenting [“21st Century Tools: How Technology Encodes Practices”](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#session_106) on the main stage Wednesday at 10:50AM. 

Alex  joined Hack Night back in the day, when he was a young bureaucrat at the Chicago Public Schools. He noticed on Twitter that a group he had never heard of had produced a lovely map to help parents, students, teachers navigate the school system — way better than the maps CPS offered on their website at the time! He simply had to find out who these Hack Night people were.

Alex is interested in meeting all the new Chi Hack Night folks he hasn’t met since he’s been in the Bay Area!  

Alex has attended hack night with four different Brigades this year: Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, and Oakland and says meeting civic tech people across the country is fun. He also says that learning what everyone is up to is inspiring. 

Alex’s favorite Chicago meal is the one with the endless layers of meat and cheese.


## [Cathy Deng](https://twitter.com/cthydng)

\<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91210421@N03/21170623153/in/dateposted-public/" title="cathydeng"\>\<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5725/21170623153_38dd72da1c_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="cathydeng"\>\</a\>\<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"\>\</script\>

Cathy Deng joined Chi Hack Night because she digs because she digs cross-pollination! Unlike most tech meetups, ChiHackNight is defined by a mission rather than by any particular technology or industry - that makes room for lotsa interdisciplinary convos between academics, organizers, data nerds, designers, etc.

Cathy believes that technologists in 'civic tech' laud the virtues of open source tech, but in reality, open source projects are often intimidating & confusing. Her workshop (Wed 2-3pm) will focus on how new folks can make sense of open source projects & how maintainers can make projects more accessible.

Cathy is interested in meeting folks who dig information design, folks who are working on something playful/creative, and folks who want to reflect on civic tech failures. 

Cathy is the developer behind the [Expunge.io](www.expunge.io) project - a youth-led project that help people expunge their juvenile record. This is Cathy’s second year as a Summit Speaker. Last year she talked about her work on Expunge.io:

Christopher will be helping to run the Brigade Pre-Summit - look for the American flag t-shirt and sneakers. 

Christopher would love to meet everyone at the Summit, but is particularly interested in meeting people who are working directly with government to help make things better on the front lines. 

Christopher is currently a consultant for the Code for America Ecosystem Team and is the author of _The @CivicWhitaker Anthology_ which will come out sometime during Summit. 

Christopher is staunchly team deep dish. 

## [Claire Micklin](http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/) 

\<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91210421@N03/21603517400/in/dateposted-public/" title="clairemicklin"\>\<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/21603517400_7b94b1705b_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="clairemicklin"\>\</a\>\<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"\>\</script\>

Claire Micklin first discovered Chi Hack Night through Chicago Women Developers, who sent out an invitation to the Divvy Data Challenge presentation. She attended the presentation and was fascinated by all opportunities at Chi Hack Night to make apps that helped citizens and government engage better with their cities and communities.

Claire will be speaking twice at the CfA Summit. First, on Wednesday, September 30 (3:15-4:15pm), She’ll be speaking on a panel called [Communicating with Citizens Using Data Visualization](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_123) which explores how data visualizations can be used to engage citizens around government transparency, transportation issues, urban planning, and environmental resiliency.

Then, on Thursday, October 1, (4:30-5:30pm) She’ll be co-presenting with Derek Eder at the [Lessons from Organizing Chi Hack night](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_157). Derek will focus on how Chi Hack Night is run and what makes it successful. Claire will present a case study on how she managed the process of creating My Building Doesn’t Recycle, a project that which was brought into existence at Chi Hack Night.

You can also catch her demo-ing [My Building Doesn’t Recycle](http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/) at the Tech Fair, on Thursday, October 1, 12:30-2:30pm. 

Claire is interesting in meeting people who are interested in how a user-centered design process (ideation to shipping and beyond) and how it can be leveraged to produce civic tech that is engaging and has impact. She is also interested in civic tech that is aimed at affecting policy change. 

Claire is the proud parent of a now-thriving formerly stray, toothless, tailless cat named Matias and her favorite Chicago food is El Milagro Tortillas and tortilla chips.

Demond will be presenting on [Digital literacy and power at Digital Inclusion Meets Civic Tech (Wed 9/30, 3:15pm, Salon C)](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_116). 

Demond would love to meet anyone interested in digital literacy - from basic skills to coding.

Demond is now a founder at [Coderspace](http://coderspace.org/) in Chicago. CoderSpace youth learn how to code and work together to build websites for local businesses and organizations. They operate on a team-based, project-based learning model. Coderspace believes the best learning happens in context and within teams.

## [Derek Eder](http://www.twitter.com/derekeder)

\<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91210421@N03/21779812712/in/dateposted-public/" title="derekeder"\>\<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5675/21779812712_dd86e75403_q.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="derekeder"\>\</a\>\<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"\>\</script\>

Derek Eder started the Chi Hack Night because he needed a place to work on civic tech projects outside my 9-5 job. Civic tech is  now his 9-5 job so he go to it to talk to amazing people and scheme about new projects. 

Derek will be presenting on the civic volunteerism model we have pioneered at the Chi Hack Night, how it has evolved over time, and how others can nurture similar communities in their cities. 

Derek is interested in meeting up with all the wonderful friends he’s gotten to know in the last four years. 

Derek is the founder of the civic tech web development shop [DataMade](www.datamade.us) where he’s worked on numerous projects including [Largelots.org](www.largelots.org) and [Chicagosmilliondollarblocks.org](http://chicagosmilliondollarblocks.com/). This is Derek’s second year presenting at Chi Hack Night. You can see his presentation last year on Largelots.org below:

[Derek Eder](https://twitter.com/derekeder) and [Demond Drummer](https://twitter.com/citizendrummer) will tell the story of [LargeLots.org](http://largelots.org/), a site for residents in Greater Englewood and East Garfield Park to purchase vacant, city owned lots for $1. 

This will be a preview of the talk they're giving at the [Code for America Summit](http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/) on September 23rd. They'll cover the policy inception, the evolution of the website, lessons learned and what's next for the site and the program.

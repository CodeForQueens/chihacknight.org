#### New Feature: Topic Facilitators

One of the outcomes of our first Leadership Council Meeting was the idea of having facilitators to help guide conversations and potential apps for specific topics. The facilitators and topics are:

* __Transportation__: [Steve Vance](https://twitter.com/stevevance)
* __Education__: [Elnaz Moshfeghian](https://twitter.com/elnazem), [Josh Kalov](https://twitter.com/shua123)
* __City data__: [Gene Lynes](https://twitter.com/Geneorama), [Tom Schenk](https://twitter.com/tomschenkjr)
* __Orientation__: [Christopher Whitaker](https://twitter.com/CivicWhitaker)

__Want to start your own topic?__ Mention it at the meeting and we'll get you set up! Please note that becoming a facilitator will require committing to coming to hack nights on a regular basis and/or finding a backup to come when you can't.

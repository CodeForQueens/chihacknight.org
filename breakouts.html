<h1>Breakout groups</h1>

<p>Every week after the presentation, we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps. The groups are split into two types: <strong>working</strong> groups and <strong>learning</strong> groups.</p>

<p>Want to start your own breakout group? Just mention it at the next hack night and people will vote with their feet!</p>

<h3 id='learning'>Learning groups</h3>
<p>Educational sessions about civic hacking, programming, working with data and troubleshooting help.</p>

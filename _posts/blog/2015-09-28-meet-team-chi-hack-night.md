**Why did you join Chi Hack Night?**

Cathy Deng joined Chi Hack Night because she digs because she digs cross-pollination! Unlike most tech meetups, ChiHackNight is defined by a mission rather than by any particular technology or industry - that makes room for lotsa interdisciplinary convos between academics, organizers, data nerds, designers, etc.

**What are you presenting at the Summit?**

Cathy believes that technologists in 'civic tech' laud the virtues of open source tech, but in reality, open source projects are often intimidating & confusing. Her workshop (Wed 2-3pm) will focus on how new folks can make sense of open source projects & how maintainers can make projects more accessible.

**Who are you interested in meeting?**

Cathy is interested in meeting folks who dig information design, folks who are working on something playful/creative, and folks who want to reflect on civic tech failures. 

**What would you like to brag about?**

Cathy is the developer behind the [Expunge.io](http://www.expunge.io) project - a youth-led project that help people expunge their juvenile record. This is Cathy’s second year as a Summit Speaker. Last year she talked about her work on Expunge.io:

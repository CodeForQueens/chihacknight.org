<h1>Chi Hack Night Leadership Council</h1>

Every month, we have an open Chi Hack Night Leadership Council meeting for anyone who is interested in being involved in running the hack night, taking on new projects, or doing training sessions.

If youâ€™d like to bring up a topic, add it to the agenda.

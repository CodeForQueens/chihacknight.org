A [Chicago Tribune investigation](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-red-light-camera-ticket-spikes-met-20140717,0,704793.story) recently found that the Cityâ€™s [red light camera program](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/red-light_cameraenforcement.html) may have been ticketing thousands of drivers unfairly during suspicious spikes. 

[Alex Bordens](https://twitter.com/alexbordens) and [Alex Richards](https://twitter.com/alexrichards) will discuss how the Tribune analyzed more than 4 million tickets and created an [interactive database to help readers find out if they were ticketed during a spike](http://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/local/red-light-camera-tickets/).
